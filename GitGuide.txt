Pushing code from your local system to remote system via COMMAND LINE INTERFACE ie. Command Prompt.

Steps to follow --
1. Make your GITHUB Account
2. Make a new empty repository
3. Add a new file named "readme.md" in this new repo.
   Basically this "readme.md" file is used for descriptive text.
4. Now Commit this file in your local system.
  (Basically when you do git add [file name] - it move your mdification to staging area and            when you do git commit, it performs commit in your local system.

These steps just needs to be performed first time when we were setting the environment.
--Now set up the basic git's configuration
5. git config --global user.name "ErAlisha"
6. git config --global user.email "alishachhabra1111@gmail.com"
7. git remote add origin https://github.com/ErAlisha/myRepos.git ,, only needs to map a new repository with github,only while initialising new repository.
8. git push -u origin master

//So, normally we'll be doing
1.Git add folder/file name
2. Git commit -m"commit message"
3. git push -u origin master
And finally your commit will be reflected on github also.

Writing good commit message is a skill. Let's understand this.
feat - a new feature
fix - a bug fix
docs - changes in documentation
style - everything related to styling
refactor - code changes that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
test - everything related to testing
chore - updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc

1. cd .. is used to move backwards ie.in your parent directory
2. cd "folder name" to move aage
